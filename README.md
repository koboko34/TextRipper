# TextRipper

Purpose of this project is to create an application which parses text from multiple websites and produced a neatly
formatted text file containing the desired text. In this file I will attempt to compile the text from 266 chapters of
お隣の天使様 into a single text file, with sections for each chapter.

Source = https://ncode.syosetu.com/n8440fe/
Chapter 1 = https://ncode.syosetu.com/n8440fe/1/
Chapter 2 = https://ncode.syosetu.com/n8440fe/2/
etc...
